[00:07.82] I was buried beneath my shame
[00:15.89] Who could carry that kind of weight?
[00:23.30] It was my tomb
[00:27.26] 'Til I met You
[00:34.26] 
[00:31.96] I was breathing but not alive
[00:39.95] All my failures I tried to hide
[00:47.45] It was my tomb
[00:51.29] 'Til I met You
[00:58.29] 
[00:55.32] You called my name
[00:58.42] And I ran out of that grave
[01:03.34] Out of the darkness
[01:06.39] Into Your glorious day
[01:17.39] 
[01:11.43] You called my name
[01:14.20] And I ran out of that grave
[01:19.52] Out of the darkness
[01:22.13] Into Your glorious day
[01:27.18] Your glorious day
[01:35.68] 
[01:32.28] Your mercy has saved my soul
[01:40.05] Now Your freedom is all that I know
[01:47.49] The old made new
[01:51.23] When I met You
[01:58.23] 
[01:55.37] You called my name
[01:58.37] And I ran out of that grave
[02:03.25] Out of the darkness
[02:06.24] Into Your glorious day
[02:17.24] 
[02:11.25] You called my name
[02:14.15] And I ran out of that grave
[02:19.20] Out of the darkness
[02:22.37] Into Your glorious day
[02:33.37] 
[02:40.97] I needed rescue, my sin was heavy
[02:44.71] But chains break at the weight of Your glory
[02:48.79] I needed shelter, I was an orphan
[02:52.95] Now You call me a citizen of Heaven
[03:10.45] 
[02:56.92] When I was broken, You were my healing
[03:00.63] Now Your love is the air that I'm breathing
[03:04.72] I have a future, my eyes are open
[03:08.68] 'Cause when You called my name
[03:23.68] 
[03:12.50] I ran out of that grave!
[03:17.50] Out of the darkness
[03:20.40] Into Your glorious day
[03:31.40] 
[03:25.22] You called my name
[03:28.23] And I ran out of that grave
[03:33.28] Out of the darkness
[03:36.35] Into Your glorious day
